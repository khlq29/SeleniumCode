# SeleniumCode
# Selenium Hybrid Framework

## Overview

This repository contains a hybrid automation testing framework built with Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and other supporting technologies. The framework is designed to provide a scalable, modular, and maintainable structure for automated testing of web applications.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture:** The framework follows a modular architecture, separating test scripts, page objects, and utility functions to enhance maintainability.

- **Data-Driven Testing:** Supports data-driven testing by integrating external data sources such as Excel, CSV, or databases.

- **Keyword-Driven Testing:** Implements a keyword-driven approach for creating and executing test scenarios using simple, descriptive keywords.

- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Provides cross-browser testing capabilities with configuration options for different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

- **Parallel Execution:** Utilizes TestNG to enable parallel test execution, reducing overall test suite execution time.

- **Logging and Reporting:** Incorporates logging mechanisms to capture detailed execution logs and generates HTML reports for test results.

- **Configuration Management:** Centralized configuration management for easy maintenance and flexibility in changing test configurations.
